    <ol><h1><i>a)	Steve Jobs;</i></h1><img src ="jobs.jpg"width="150px" height="180px" /></ol>
        
        <p>He made technology not look like technology but more like a way of life. The best business-to-business solutions today are the ones that claim ease of use and intuitiveness despite the complex technology they are based on. </p>
        
    <ol><h2><i>b)	Steve Wozniak;</i> </h2><img src ="woz.jpg"width="150px" height="150px" /></ol>

        <p>I have always been fascinated by Steve Wozniak. Here was the man who pioneered the personal computer and who would go on to develop and improve upon a number of key technologies, including those relating to floppy disk controllers and graphic display systems -- all in an effort to keep the design simple and the costs low. Steve is a true problem solver and continues to be an inspiration. - Chris Kirby </p>

<ol><h3><i>c)	Marc Andreessen;</i></h3><img src ="marc.jpeg"width="150px" height="150px" /></ol> 
       
        <p>Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape and now venture capitalist at Andreessen Horowitz. He’s an amazing technologist who was instrumental in bringing the power of the internet to the masses through the world’s first viable web browser, and he's got a brilliant business mind to boot.</p>  
        </ol>
    <ol><h4><i>d)	Nikola Tesla;</i></h4><img src ="tesla.jpeg"width="150px" height="150px" /></ol>
        
        <p>Tesla made me painfully aware of the difference between the inventor and the innovator. His technological prowess and insight remain unprecedented. His mistakes were never in his mathematical calculations, but in his social miscalculations. He reminds me to look past the technological threshold and into the quality and character of those who surround me in the short and the long term.</p>
